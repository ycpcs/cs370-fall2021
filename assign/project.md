title: "Final Project: Think Inside the Box!"

**Program Due:**

**Milestone 1: Thur, Oct 14th by 2:00 PM**  7.5% - This milestone should demonstrate the basic geometry of the scene (placeholder objects can be used where more complex objects will eventually be located). An orthographic "birds-eye" view is acceptable at this point to see the entire room.

**Milestone 2: Thur, Nov 11th by 2:00 PM**  7.5- This milestone should contain most of the geometry that will appear in the final scene. First person camera controls should allow movement throughout the room (but not necessarily with collision detection). Lighting effects should be present.

**Final Presentation:** 85% - Your final project will be demonstrated during the final exam period for your section (see the [schedule](../labs/schedule.html)). MAKE SURE to complete the [self-evaluation form](CS370_Final_Project_eval.docx) and submit it with your project. Late assignments will **NOT** be accepted.

**Evaluation Form** Word document for the [self-evaluation form](CS370_Final_Project_eval.docx).

## Getting Started

Download [CS370\_Project.zip](src/CS370_Project.zip), saving it into the **CS370-Fall2021** directory.

Double-click on **CS370\_Project.zip** and extract the contents of the archive into a subdirectory called **CS370\_Project**

Open CLion, select **CS370-Fall2021** from the main screen (you may need to close any open projects), and open the **CMakeLists.txt** file in this directory (**not** the one in the **CS370\_Assign01** subdirectory). Add the line

```cpp
	add_subdirectory("CS370_Project" "CS370_Project/bin")
```

Finally, select **Reload changes** which should build the project and add **house** to the dropdown menu at the top of the IDE window.

The skeleton project is primarily an empty source that simply draws a red cube viewed from an orthographic perspective (this may be useful as you create your geometry). There are shaders and routines provided for drawing solid color objects, objects using lighting, and texture mapped objects. You may add any additional header files and resources (e.g. images, shaders, models) as desired.

## Programming assignment

The object of this project is to do a "walk through" of a room. You should create a room with various lighting and texture mapped objects such that the user can "walk through" the room to view it from different locations/orientations (the basis of a fps).

-   The room should have a floor, ceiling, and four walls (but need not be square).

    > -   Put "carpet" on the floor.
    > -   The other walls can simply be "painted" a solid color.

-   One of the walls should have a door made of "wood".

    > -   It can be a slab door.
    > -   Hinges and a door knob are optional.

-   An adjacent wall should have a window with a mini-blind.

    > -   Use 'O' (or 'o') to open and close the blinds revealing an outdoor scene through the window. (Hint: Use a texture mapped rectangle for the window pane.)

-   The opposite wall should have a large mirror that "reflects" the room.
-   The fourth wall should have a work of art hanging on it.
-   Place a "wooden" table and chairs in the center of the room.

    > -   Place a soda can on the table.
    > -   Place a translucent glass partially full of soda on the table.
    > -   Place a bowl of "spherical" fruit on the table.

-   Add a rotating ceiling fan on the ceiling.

    > -   A wall switch should toggle the fan via 'F' (or 'f'). You do not need to worry about proximity to the switch to operate it.

-   Add a light located at the center of the ceiling - roughly where the ceiling fan is.

    > -   A wall switch should toggle the light via 'L' (or 'l'). You do not need to worry about proximity to the switch to operate it.

-   The first person camera view should be able to

    > -   'W' (or 'w') - move forward in the CURRENT direction
    > -   'S' (or 's') - move backward in the CURRENT direction
    > -   'A' (or 'a') - turn left (azimuth)
    > -   'D' (or 'd') - turn right (azimuth)
    > -   'Z' (or 'z') - look up (elevation)
    > -   'X' (or 'x') - look down (elevation)

-   The camera should remain at a *fixed height* (i.e. "eye level").
-   The camera should *not* leave the room (although you do not need to worry about object avoidance within the room).
-   The field of view and frustum distance should be fixed *relative to the camera*.
-   All animations should be system *independent*, i.e. should be time-based, including fan rotation, blinds opening, etc.
-   All effects should be done in programmable shaders.

## Hints

**START EARLY!** You should be developing the scene incrementally such that you always have a working program prior to adding an additional feature.

Some embellishment suggestions:

-   Implement "mouselook" typical of standard fps (along with 'a' and 'd' strafing)
-   Use a 3D modelling program such as Blender to create more sophisticated geometry
-   Use enhanced programmable shader effects to add effects beyond default pipeline behavior.

Most of all - **HAVE FUN!** and be creative with this project.

### First Person Camera

In order to accomplish a first person camera where the controls move or rotate the camera along the viewing direction, we will use an approach similar to the spherical coordinates discussed in [Lab 6](../labs/lab06.html). We will use an azimuth angle, θ, to create the **center** vector *relative* to the **eye** vector which will define a vector for the direction the camera is facing. Thus when we move forward or backward, we will simply update **eye** along this direction (with a corresponding update of **center**). Rotation will simply update **center** via θ since it does not involve a change in camera position.

Thus from a top down view

> <img src="images/project/camera.png" alt="Camera Diagram" height="300"/>

Thus we can compute the coordinates of *center* (whenever we adjust *eye* or change θ) as

> *center*<sub>x</sub> = *eye*<sub>x</sub> + cos(θ)
>
> *center*<sub>y</sub> = *eye*<sub>y</sub>
>
> *center*<sub>z</sub> = *eye*<sub>z</sub> + sin(θ)

To move along the current direction, we can compute a direction vector (component-wise in *x* and *z*) as

> *dir* = *center* - *eye*
    
Then we can update *eye* along *dir* by an amount Δ (component-wise in *x* and *z*) as

> *eye* = *eye* + *dir*\*Δ

which will then require a corresponding update in *center* as described above.

Adjusting the camera to look up/down can be done by adjusting the *y* component of *center* with an elevation angle (typically *without* adjusting the *y* component of *eye*).

## Grading Criteria

**The program MUST compile to receive any credit** (so develop incrementally).

The program will be graded based on the number of features implemented along with the creativity used to implement each one.

## Compiling and running the program

You should be able to build and run the program by selecting **house** in the dropdown box in the toolbar and clicking the small green arrow next to it.

> <img src="images/project/House.png" alt="Final Project Window" height="500"/>

To quit the program simply close the window.

## Submitting

When you are done, submit the assignment to **Google Drive** using the Terminal window in CLion (click **Terminal** at the bottom left of the IDE). Navigate to the directory using

<pre>
$ <b>cd CS370_Project</b>
CS370-Fall2021/CS370_Project
$ <b>make zip</b>
</pre>

This will create a **solution.zip** file in your project directory. **RENAME THIS FILE** with your ycp username and upload it to Google Drive.

**DO NOT** submit the project through Marmoset. Manually upload your zip file to the shared Google drive.

**You are responsible for making sure that your submission contains the correct file(s).**
